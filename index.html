      <p>Hi, my name is Giancarlo Tzquierdo, and I'm currently a Full Stack Development student at the University of Denver Boot Camp. Outside of being a student, I'm a Father of two beautiful children and a Husband to my beautiful wife. External passions that I have and that I use to correlate with coding is powerlifting. In the sport of powerlifting I have accomplished many things such a couple deadlift records in different federations.   </p>

      <p>My main goal with this program is to complete it and successfully obtain a position as a jr developer. I look forward to the journey and growing my skill set. If you're interested in working together, please reach out.</p>
